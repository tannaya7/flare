# 📄 DocumentVault — Simple On-Chain Document Storage (Solidity)

A **beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract** that lets you securely save and verify document fingerprints (hashes) on the blockchain.  
Ideal for learning **Flare, EVM, and decentralized storage** concepts with a clean and minimal design.

## 🚀 What it does

✅ Stores unique **document hashes** on-chain  
✅ Keeps a **timestamp** for each saved document  
✅ Ensures only the **contract owner (deployer)** can add documents  
✅ Allows anyone to **view and verify** stored document hashes by index

Think of it like a **blockchain-powered digital vault** for document proof and integrity!
